### I have tried to classify Quasars, Galaxies and Stars using photometric data.
### Motivations:
Large catalogs of unlabelled stellar objects are available. Labelling these stellar objects is important for a number of reasons. E.g: for statistical poulation analyses and for [testing cosmological models](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/444/1/2/1016765) to name a few. Although these stellar objects can be classified by analyzing their optical spectrums but that process is time consuming. [Next generation of telescopes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...873..111I/abstract) will increase the quantity of available unlabelled data even more! That's why we have tried to use the photometric data and a combination of machine learning approaches to label the stellar objects.

### Results
The results were:
- For objects correctly_classified as Quasars, 90.3% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Quasar.
- For objects correctly_classified as Galaxies, 86.7% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Galaxy.
- For objects correctly_classified as Stars, 99.6% of them had a probability greater than 0.9 of being a Star.
